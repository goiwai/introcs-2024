# Usage

Version 8 or later of GCC is required to build some C++17-enabled programs. Since CentOS7 build-in GCC is version 4.8, we need to have extra work for installing the C++17 supported compiler.

To use the prebuilt version of GCC, run like `module load gcc/830` before `make`.

```shell
% make
# creates:
#   file-main-c++11.exe
#   file-main-c++17.exe
#   variable-arguments-main.exe
```
